# jte

jte stands for joe's text editor.

jte has gone through several iterations.
The first was essentially a go port of [kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).
I've since expanded and altered the code to fit more to my style and how I want an editor to work.

the goal is to be a vim-like cross platform editor that is dependency free.
